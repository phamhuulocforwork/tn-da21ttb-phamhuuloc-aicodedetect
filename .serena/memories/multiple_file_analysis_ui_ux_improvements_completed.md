### 5. **Skeleton Loading States**
- âœ… `FileAnalysisSkeleton` component for loading placeholders
- âœ… Shows skeleton cards during processing
- âœ… Dynamic skeleton count based on remaining files
- âœ… Smooth transitions between states

### 6. **Advanced Processing States**
- âœ… Pure processing state (only skeletons)
- âœ… Mixed state (completed + processing skeletons)
- âœ… Progress tracking with file counts
- âœ… Real-time status updates

### 7. **UI/UX Enhancements**
